Subject: [PATCH 1808/2463] ENGR00215346: mmc: esdhc: change to use sdma
 instead of adma due to ic limit.

Due to ic issue, adma2 failed to work when ahb freq is slow (<50Mhz),
while SDMA does not have issue.

workaround:
- use SDMA instead.

performance comparison between SDMA & ADMA:

|			|	SDMA		|	ADMA		|
---------------------------------------------------------------------
| wifi downlink*	|	~38Mbps		|	~38Mbps		|
| memory card**	| ~20MBps(r)/~4MBps(w)	| ~20MBps(r)/~9MBps(w)	|

* wifi downlink throughput is tested by iperf in open air.
** writing performance for SDMA is much slower than ADMA, it might
be an issue which needs further investigation.
