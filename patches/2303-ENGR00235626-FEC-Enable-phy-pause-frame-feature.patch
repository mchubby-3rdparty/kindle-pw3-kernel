Subject: [PATCH 2303/2463] ENGR00235626 FEC: Enable phy pause frame feature

Since some ethernet MAC flow control is relied on phy pause
status, both link partners exchange information via auto neg to
determine if both parties are capable of flow control.
Advertise phy pause frame to avoid pause frame is not responsed
by the other net node.
