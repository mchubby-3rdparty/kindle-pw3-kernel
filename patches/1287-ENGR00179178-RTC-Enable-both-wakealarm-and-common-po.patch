Subject: [PATCH 1287/2463] ENGR00179178 [RTC]Enable both wakealarm and common
 power wakeup

For RTC driver, as not all RTCs support alarm and wakeup, so the
framework only support alarm or wakeup, not both of them, as our
rtc can support alarm and wakeup function, to simplify the unit
test interface for power off and wakeup, we add both wakealarm and
common power wakeup sysfs interface to our RTC driver.
