Subject: [PATCH 1852/2463] ENGR00219178 [MX6]Need to avoid using GPIO_1 on
 latest B4 sabresd board

For the latest B4 sabresd board, GPIO_1 is connected to PRO_B, we
use this pin as battery charge_done led control, need to avoid using
this pin as GPIO for B4 board, or system will reboot when this pin's
level is changed.
