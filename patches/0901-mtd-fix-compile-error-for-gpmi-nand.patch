Subject: [PATCH 0901/2463] mtd: fix compile error for gpmi-nand

The driver gpmi-nand should compile at least.  This patch adds the
missing gpmi-nand.h to fix the compile error below.

  CC      drivers/mtd/nand/gpmi-nand/gpmi-nand.o
  CC      drivers/mtd/nand/gpmi-nand/gpmi-lib.o
drivers/mtd/nand/gpmi-nand/gpmi-nand.c:25:33: fatal error: linux/mtd/gpmi-nand.h: No such file or directory
drivers/mtd/nand/gpmi-nand/gpmi-lib.c:21:33: fatal error: linux/mtd/gpmi-nand.h: No such file or directory

This header is grabbed from patch below, which has not been postponed
for merging.

  [PATCH v8 1/4] ARM: mxs: add GPMI-NAND support for imx23/imx28

+ * struct gpmi_nand_platform_data - GPMI NAND driver platform data.
+ *
+ * This structure communicates platform-specific information to the GPMI NAND
+ * driver that can't be expressed as resources.
+ *
+ * @platform_init:           A pointer to a function the driver will call to
+ *                           initialize the platform (e.g., set up the pin mux).
+ * @min_prop_delay_in_ns:    Minimum propagation delay of GPMI signals to and
+ *                           from the NAND Flash device, in nanoseconds.
+ * @max_prop_delay_in_ns:    Maximum propagation delay of GPMI signals to and
+ *                           from the NAND Flash device, in nanoseconds.
+ * @max_chip_count:          The maximum number of chips for which the driver
+ *                           should configure the hardware. This value most
+ *                           likely reflects the number of pins that are
+ *                           connected to a NAND Flash device. If this is
+ *                           greater than the SoC hardware can support, the
+ *                           driver will print a message and fail to initialize.
+ * @partitions:              An optional pointer to an array of partition
+ *                           descriptions.
+ * @partition_count:         The number of elements in the partitions array.
