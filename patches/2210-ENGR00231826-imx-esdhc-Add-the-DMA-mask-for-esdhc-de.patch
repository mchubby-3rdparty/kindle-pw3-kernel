Subject: [PATCH 2210/2463] ENGR00231826 imx esdhc: Add the DMA mask for esdhc
 device register.

We must set the DMA mask for esdhc device.
To avoid the following crash when we do not have highmem pages:

[<c014ca0c>] (rescan_partitions+0x15c/0x480) from [<c012f190>]
[<c012f190>] (__blkdev_get+0x324/0x394) from [<c012f300>]
[<c012f300>] (blkdev_get+0x100/0x358) from [<c023e5f4>]

[<c03a7820>] (mmc_blk_probe+0x15c/0x20c) from [<c039cc90>]
[<c039cc90>] (mmc_bus_probe+0x18/0x1c) from [<c0294e28>]

When our DDR size is small or reserved memory are large and
the lowmem can cover all the available pages for kernel,
the highmem pages will not be setup. That means the page_pool
for bounce queue can not be create in init_emergency_pool().
And page_pool will stay NULL without initialized.
In the mmc/card/queue.c the blk_queue_bounce_limit()
function will be called in mmc_init_queue() to
initialize the request_queue and it's bounce_gfp.
If we do not define the DMA mask for our platform,
then the BLK_BOUNCE_HIGH (lowmem pfn) will be set
as limit to queue bounce, which means the blk_queue_bounce
will use page_pool to iterate over the bio segment.
Under the circumstances that highmem is not setup,
the page_pool is null, and causes kernel crash.
After set the DMA mask for esdhci device, the page_pool
will not be used to iterate over the bio segment.
