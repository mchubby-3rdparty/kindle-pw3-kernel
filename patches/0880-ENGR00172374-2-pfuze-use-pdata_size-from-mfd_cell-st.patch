Subject: [PATCH 0880/2463] ENGR00172374-2: pfuze: use pdata_size from
 mfd_cell struct

fix the building errors when upgrade to v3.0

we use data_size from mfd_cell struct on 2.6.38, but after that
there are some changes for this field of mfd_cell struct, see:

    mfd: Drop data_size from mfd_cell struct

    Now that there are no more users of this, drop it.

and this:

    mfd: Add platform data pointer back

    Now that we have a way to pass MFD cells down to the sub drivers,
    we can gradually get rid of mfd_data by putting the platform pointer
    back in place.

    Signed-off-by: Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>

But the above commit also change the name from data_size to pdata_size,
This patch just give one fix for the pfuze driver to use pdata_size field.
