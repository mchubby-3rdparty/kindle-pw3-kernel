Subject: [PATCH 1238/2463] ENGR00177756 usb-host: quit system suspend after
 usb remote wakeup occurs

If the usb remote wakeup occurs before bus(roothub) suspend, it can
stop the system suspend process, the patch adds handle error message
process for roothub.

If the remote wakeup occurs after bus(roothub) suspend, then
the suspend will go on suspending, and usb phy will fail to respond
wakeup signal.

This patch is suggested by: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>
